    # Clean env vars and virtual envs of J workspaces
    #
    # When we switch from one work environment to another, we often want to
    # clean up all env vars and virtual envs related to other workspaces. For
    # this, it is necessary to have a function that automatically does it for
    # us.
    # Because all environment variables related to type J workspaces are
    # configured in this file, the purpose of this feature is to clean all envs
    # for all things related to this type of workspaces that are loaded via
    # functions.
    #
    # Tip: it would be ideal if every time you change your environment, this
    # function runs automatically to clean everything, before setting new envs
    # again. For that, you can use the function zshrc.cleanworkspaces, which
    # executes this function and the analogous one for H workspaces.

    true; # remove this after fill this function
