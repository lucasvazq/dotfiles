When a new day starts, the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) is selected as your new wallpaper.
Based on the colors of this image, the general color scheme of the rest of the components of your ship was established.
I've improved it for Python hunting, while the command center is built with Vscode, the database is handled by psqalien and communications are done with Octocat and Heroku.

ðŸ§² âš¡ **Requirements:** Manjaro I3

## Ready, Set, Launch ðŸš€

Run the following commands
```sh
cd && git clone git@github.com:lucasvazq/dotfiles && cd dotfiles # Positionate and download the repo
./setup.sh # Start launch
shutdown -r now # Restart the system
```

After rebooting, there are other commands you should run on the fly

**Establish the communication channel with Octocat and Heroku**
```sh
heroku login
git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
```
