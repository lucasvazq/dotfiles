  ‚ÄúOrion over Argentine Mountains‚Äù - Picture of the day by Nicolas Tabbush. June 9th, 2020

Every time your Starship turns on, the (https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)[Astronomy Picture of the Day] is selected as your new wallpaper.
Based on the colors of this image, the general color scheme of the rest of the components of your ship was established.
I've improved the ship for Python snake hunting, while the command center is built with Vscode and communications are made with the Octocat.

# Ready, Set, Launch üöÄ

Run the following commands
```sh
cd && git clone git@github.com:lucasvazq/dotfiles && cd dotfiles # Positionate and dowload the repo
./setup.sh  # Start launch
shutdown -r now # restart the system
```

After restart, there's some manual installation steps

#### Establish the communication channel with Octocat

```sh
git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
```
